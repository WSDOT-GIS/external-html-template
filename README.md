# External HTML template

This repository contains the necessary HTML, JavaScript and CSS files which
produce an example, responsive HTML application template reflective of the pages
on WSDOT's external, public facing website.

These files incorporate the look and feel of the site as of the November 7, 2021
launch.

The latest version of these files can be downloaded in the **Releases** section.

It is encouraged to create a GitHub account and to **Watch** this repository. By
doing so, you can be alerted of all activity on this repository and can stay
updated with any changes made to the code.

## Usage

The application template is responsive and implements a mobile-friendly approach
for the end-user experience. Mobile-friendly refers to the practice of developing
a website that is designed to work the same way across different devices. Keep
this in mind when adding your content to the template.

Your pages should scale from the smaller screens on smartphones to the medium
tablet sizes to the larger desktop screens.

Do not assume everyone is accessing your content using a desktop computer.
